# Project Overview:Task Manager App

A Task Manager app allows users to `create, manage, and track tasks, set deadlines, and categorize`
them by priority or project. It includes features like user authentication, real-time updates,
offline capabilities, and performance optimization.

## Key Features:

### User Authentication:

1. Implement user sign-up, login, and authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
2. Store user credentials securely in MongoDB.

### Task Management:

1. Allow users to create, update, and delete tasks.
2. Categorize tasks by project, priority, or due date.
3. Use MongoDB to store task data and implement CRUD operations.

### Real-Time Notifications:

1. Notify users in real-time when a task is due soon or when deadlines are approaching.
2. Implement Redis as a message broker for real-time updates and caching frequently accessed data.

### Offline Support:

1. Use React Native’s local storage to allow users to manage tasks even when they are offline.
2. Sync data with the server when the user reconnects to the internet.

### Search and Filtering

1. Implement search functionality to allow users to find tasks quickly.
2. Use MongoDB's powerful querying capabilities to filter tasks by various criteria (e.g.,
   status,due date).

### Performance Optimization:

1. Cache frequently accessed data (like user sessions and task lists) using Redis.
2. Optimize backend performance by reducing database load with Redis caching.

### Push Notifications:

1. Implement push notifications to remind users of upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks.
2. Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending push notifications.

## Tech Stack:

1. `Frontend`: React Native
2. `Backend`: Node.js with Express.js
3. `Database`: MongoDB for persistent storage
4. `Caching/Real-Time`: Redis for caching and handling real-time notifications

## Development Roadmap:

### Week 1-2: Setting Up and Building the Backend

1. Set up Node.js with Express.js and connect to MongoDB.
2. Implement user authentication with JWT and basic CRUD operations for tasks.

### Week 3-4: Developing the Frontend

1. Set up React Native and create the basic UI for the Task Manager app.
2. Integrate with the backend API to display and manage tasks.

### Week 5: Implementing Real-Time Features and Caching

1. Set up Redis and integrate it into the Node.js backend.
2. Implement real-time notifications and caching for performance optimization.

### Week 6: Adding Offline Support and Push Notifications

1. Implement offline capabilities in the React Native app.
2. Set up push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

### Week 7: Testing and Optimization

1. Perform unit and integration testing on both the backend and frontend.
2. Optimize performance and ensure all features work seamlessly.

### Week 8: Deployment

1. Deploy the backend on a cloud service like Heroku, Vercel, or DigitalOcean.
   Distribute the React Native app through the App Store and Google Play Store.

## Why This Project?

1. `Full Stack Learning`: You’ll work on both the frontend and backend, learning how to connect them
   effectively.
2. `Database Management`: MongoDB will help you understand document-based data modeling, while
   Redisintroduces you to caching and real-time data handling.
3. `Real-World Use Case`: Task management apps are common in the real world, making this project
   relevant and practical.
4. `Scalability`: You’ll gain experience with scaling an application, handling real-time updates,and
   optimizing performance.
5. This project will give you a `comprehensive understanding` of how these technologies` work
   together and prepare you for `more complex applications` in `the future`.
